# 2FA REST API Documentation

This API allows developers to integrate Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) into their own websites or applications using your service.

---

## Quick Start for Developers

1. **Register an account** on the dashboard.
2. **Login** and go to your dashboard.
3. **Generate your API Key** by clicking the 'Generate API Key' button.
4. **Scan the QR code** (if prompted) with Google Authenticator or a similar app.
5. **Use your API Key** in the `X-API-KEY` header for all protected API requests.
6. **Refer to the API Documentation** for endpoint details and example requests.

## Authentication
- **API Key**: Each user receives a unique API Key after registration/login, visible on their dashboard.
- **Usage**: For protected endpoints, include the API Key in the HTTP header:
  - `X-API-KEY: <your_api_key>`

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** `Invalid OTP.`
- **Solution:** Ensure your device time is correct and you are using the latest OTP from your authenticator app.

**Issue:** `API Key required in X-API-KEY header.`
- **Solution:** Generate your API Key from the dashboard and include it in the request header.

**Issue:** `Invalid API Key or TOTP not set.`
- **Solution:** Make sure you have generated your API Key and completed 2FA setup.

**Issue:** Cannot scan QR code
- **Solution:** Use the manual secret to add the account in your authenticator app.

**Issue:** Still having trouble?
- **Solution:** Contact support or check the dashboard for more help.

## Notes
- Always keep your API Key secret.
- The QR code and secret should be given to the user only once (during setup).
- OTPs are time-based and valid for 30 seconds (with a Â±30s window).
- If you lose your API Key, generate a new one from your dashboard.
